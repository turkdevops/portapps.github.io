## Prerequisites

To work on the website of the [Portapps](https://portapps.io) project, you'll need the following things installed on your machine :

1. [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) - choose an available tool to install Ruby on your system (or use [Neard](https://neard.io)).
2. [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) - `$ gem install bundler`
3. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) - `$ gem install jekyll`
4. [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) - use the installer (or use [Neard](https://neard.io)).

## Installation

1. Clone this repo, or download it into a directory of your choice.
2. Inside the directory, run `bundle install` and `yarn install`.

## Usage

This will give you file watching, browser synchronisation, auto-rebuild, CSS/JS and vendor injecting :

```shell
$ gulp serve
```

Then open your browser at http://localhost:3000<br />
As this is just a Jekyll project, you can use any of the commands listed in their [docs](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/usage/).
